# Stockline
Digital Assets for Everyone. No Crypto Knowledge Required.
From Mobile Money to Global Markets

Stockline is a product from **Mocha**, built to bridge the gap between emerging markets and the global digital economy. We believe that access to financial opportunities shouldn't be limited by geography, technical knowledge, or complex onboarding processes.

### The Problem

The Problem

Billions in emerging markets use mobile money every day — sending payments, buying goods, managing savings — yet remain locked out of global investment opportunities.

Why?

Complex crypto wallets that require seed phrases and technical know-how

Interfaces built for crypto-native users, not first-timers

Multiple conversion steps between local currency, crypto, and assets

Knowledge gaps about gas fees, wallets, and exchanges

### Our Solution

Stockline removes these barriers by meeting users where they are — on mobile phones, using mobile money they already trust.

How It Works

- Familiar entry point: Purchase digital assets using Mobile Money.

- No crypto complexity: Blockchain operations are handled behind the scenes

- Instant access: From cash in hand to owning digital assets in minutes

- Real ownership: Each asset is backed by real tokens on the Solana blockchain**

#### How It Works

1. **Familiar Entry Point**: Users purchase digital assets using mobile money (like M-Pesa, Orange Money, or Airtel Money)—the same way they pay for everything else in their daily lives.

2. **No Crypto Complexity**: Behind the scenes, we handle all the blockchain complexity. Users don't need to know what a wallet address is, how to buy crypto, or what gas fees are.

3. **Instant Access**: From cash in hand to owning tokenized stocks or cryptocurrency in minutes. No bank accounts. No complicated KYC. No crypto experience needed.

4. **Real Ownership**: Every purchase is backed by real digital assets on the Solana blockchain. Users own their investments, stored securely in wallets we create and manage for them.

We chose Solana for its:
- **Speed**: Transactions confirm in seconds, not minutes
- **Low Costs**: Fees measured in fractions of a cent
- **Scalability**: Built to handle millions of users
- **Reliability**: Proven infrastructure for financial applications

But our users don't need to know any of this. They just experience fast, affordable access to global markets.
